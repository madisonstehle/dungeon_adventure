# Dungeon Adventure
## Danielle Moreau & Madison Stehle

## Program Detail:

This is an adventure game where a hero is randomly placed within a dungeon, which is randomly generated. The adventurer needs
to find the four Pillars of OO (Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism) and take them to the exit to win the
game. Some features of the dungeon will prove a hindrance to the adventurer's task (pits), while some will prove helpful (healing
and vision potions). Your task is to write a correct and well documented Python program that will simulate this adventure.

## Team Reflection:

1. what work each person did
  - Almost everything was at least attempted by both Madison and Danielle in terms of code, and whoever had something working first
    generally pushed it for group feedback/testing. Debugging was a mutual effort.
       Madison did the unittests while Danielle completed the UML.

2. estimate of time spent on project and any shortcomings the project has
  - This was a rather large project considering the amount of time we had to do it coupled with only having two teammembers.
    There was a lot more we wanted to do with this however due to time constraints could not.

3. As much as we would have loved to include a GUI, we were unable to do so at this time.
