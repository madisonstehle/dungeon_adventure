# Dungeon Adventure

## Program Detail:

This is an adventure game where a hero is randomly placed within a dungeon, which is randomly generated. The adventurer needs
to find the four Pillars of OO (Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism) and take them to the exit to win the
game. Some features of the dungeon will prove a hindrance to the adventurer's task (pits), while some will prove helpful (healing
and vision potions). Your task is to write a correct and well documented Python program that will simulate this adventure. NOTE:
You are welcome to implement a variation on this theme provided you adhere to the spirit of what is being asked on this assignment.
